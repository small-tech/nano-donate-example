# Svelte Nano Donate Demo

A simple SvelteKit project demonstrating how to use the Svelte Nano Donate component.

__Work-in-progress (Sun, Apr 4, 2021).__ Iâ€™m using this project to develop the component. It will then be pulled out into its own repository and published on npm.

## Install

```shell
npm init using small-tech/svelte-nano-donate-demo
cd svelte-nano-donate-demo
npm i
```

(Or just fork/clone using git.)

## Running/Developing

```shell
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
